As I was learning React by cloning an E-Commerce website, modal did not work as intended. I decided to prevent making the same mistake.

## What I tried

I wanted to create a onClick event that handles opening and closing modal. However, when I write the code below, the modal stayed open when I clicked outside the modal.

```jsx
function Modal({ setShow }) {
  return (
    <div
      className="absolute bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.4)] inset-0 flex items-center justify-center"
      onClick={() => setShow(false)}
    >
      <div className="bg-white w-[300px]">This is a modal</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick={() => setShow(true)}>
        <p>Click to open modal</p>
        {show && <Modal setShow={setShow} />}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

After reading this [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) article, I realized it is because of how javascript handles the event: Event Bubbling and Event Capturing

### Event Bubbling

```js
<div>
  <h1>This is h1</h1>
  <h2>This is h2</h2>
</div>
```

Assume every tag in above code has onClick event that prints their tag name. If I click on h1 tag, both h1 and div will be printed on the console because of Event Bubbling. It passes the event to the parent.

### Event Capturing

Event Capturing handles events in the opposite way. It passes events to the child. To make Event Capturing, an option should be added like following.

```js
element.addEventListener("click", handleClick, { capture: true });
```

### stopPropagation

stopPropagation is used when to stop Event Bubbling or Event Capturing. Adding a highlighted line below makes everything works as intended.

```jsx {6}
function Modal({ setShow }) {
  return (
    <div
      className="absolute bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.4)] inset-0 flex items-center justify-center"
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        setShow(false);
      }}
    >
      <div className="bg-white w-[300px]">This is a modal</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick={() => setShow(true)}>
        <p>Click to open modal</p>
        {show && <Modal setShow={setShow} />}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Then, what is this for?

I was wondering if there is any useful cases for Event Bubbling and Event Capturing. It becomes especially useful when to handle dropdown menus.

```jsx
function Dropdown() {
  return (
    <div
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation();
        console.log(e.target.innerText);
      }}
    >
      <div>Hello</div>
      <div>There</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <div onClick={() => setShow((prev) => !prev)}>
        <p>Click to open Dropdown</p>
        {show && <Dropdown />}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

I can track what menu has been clicked without writing onClick event on every menu.

### Thoughts

Sometimes, I just directly copied not knowing what the code does. And I knew how important it is to know how the language itself rather than the library or framework.
