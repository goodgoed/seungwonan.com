While I am taking the online course, I realize it would be more helpful to write a blog post for better understanding on the concept.

## What is a process?

Process is an active instance of a program that is launched in the memory.

## What information does a process contain? What does it look like?

A process holds its code (.text), variables (.data), dynamically created objects (.heap), and variables & function calls (stack). Variables stored in stack and .data are different.

## What is the address space of a process?

Even though a process is located in memory, it uses virtual address space. Using a virtual address helps OS to manage physical memory space, access authorization to memory, and more.

<SideNote>
  '&' in C language shows a virtual address. Even when two virtual addresses are
  contiguous, their physical addresses do not have to be.

## Context Switch

When creating a new process, OS also creates PCB (process control block). It contains information about program counter, CPU register values, and so on.

While single CPU can only run a single process, it constantly switches between processes in order to give a better experience. When a process is idle, OS will schedule a CPU to run another process. It is called context switch.

However, it is an expensive computation because it requires to _load and change all information from memory_ and causes _cold cache_.

## Process Creation

In most cases, processes are managed by tree-like structure in OS to keep track of all of them. There is a root process that creates child processes.

When creating a new process, parent process can either _fork_ or _exec_. _Fork_ will copy the parent PCB to a new process. _Exec_ will create a new process with new PCB.
